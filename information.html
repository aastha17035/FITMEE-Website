    <img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Yoga-vs-Gym.jpg"/>
    <p id="abc"> Yoga and traditional workouts are two distinct ways to achieve fitness.
         Yoga focuses on strength, balance, and flexibility through poses and controlled breathing, while workouts typically involve more vigorous activities like cardio and strength training to build endurance and muscle mass. Integrating both can provide a comprehensive fitness routine that addresses both the mental and physical aspects of well-being, say experts at HDFC ERGO General Insurance. 
<div>1.Yoga:</div>
<ul><li>Focus: A holistic practice that improves strength, balance, and flexibility through physical poses and breathing techniques.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Benefits: Increases blood flow, warms muscles, and helps build strength through holding poses.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Best for: Enhancing mental focus, flexibility, and balance, while also building foundational strength. </li></ul>
<div>2.Workout:</div>
<ul><li>Focus: Activities like cardio (running, cycling) and strength training (lifting weights, bodyweight exercises) that build cardiovascular endurance and muscle.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Benefits: Strengthens muscles and bones, improves cardiovascular health, and builds endurance.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Best for: Increasing heart rate, building significant muscle mass, and improving overall cardiovascular fitness. </li></ul>
<div>3.Combining both:</div>
<ul><li>You can incorporate yoga and workouts on the same day, for example, by doing yoga before a workout to warm up, or after a workout to aid in recovery and flexibility.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Combining both provides a balanced approach, with yoga focusing on flexibility and recovery while workouts build strength and endurance</li></ul></p>
