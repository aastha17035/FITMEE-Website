        <h1 class="yoga"> YOGA</h1><li></li>
        <p> <li>"Yoga is not just physical exercise. It's an emotional integration, spiritual elevation, with a touch of a mystic element, which gives you a glimpse of something which is beyond all imagination."</li>

<a><li>~ Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</li></a><li></li>

<li>Yoga is a complete science; it unites body, mind and spirit and also the universe. It brings peace and bliss to every individual. It also creates a significant difference in one’s behavior, thoughts, and attitude. Daily practice of yoga increases our tranquility, sensitivity, intuition, and awareness.</li><li></li>

<b><li>What are yoga asanas?</li></b>
<li>Our mind is like a pendulum; swinging from the past to the future, regret, and anger to anxiety and fear, happiness to sorrow. It is ‘Yoga asana’ that enables us to maintain equanimity. Yoga asana is not a mere workout or exercise!</li>
<li>As described in Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra -“sthira sukham asanam”–it means Yoga asana is a balance of effort and ease. We give the effort to get into the posture and then we relax. Yoga asana brings that balance in every aspect of our life. It teaches us to put effort and then let go, to get detached from the result. Yoga asana increases our physical flexibility and expands our mind.
Yoga has to be done with the breath, and with awareness. When we lift our hands for yoga, first we become aware of the arm, and then we slowly lift it, synchronized with the breath. It is as graceful as a dance, gliding into one posture from another. The key is to stretch a little more, in each asana, than what we are comfortable with and then relax and let go. This little effort to take the body beyond its agreeable limit expands our mind.</li>
<li>Another Yoga Sutra by Patanjali says “prayatna shaithilyaananta samapattibhyam”–Again it reiterates the same philosophy. Give effort and then let go and by doing so Infinity dawns in our awareness, our awareness expands!</li>

        <img src="https://manage.ayurbethaniya.org/uploads/media/Ardha%20Chandrasana%20(1)66dee2651c804.jpg" class="image1"/>
Ardha chakrasan is a useful pose for improving posture and lowering stress because it reverses the natural tendency to circle the shoulders and slump forward. It eases stress by releasing the shoulders and neck. It is best to perform Ardha chakrasan early in the morning, on an empty stomach. Maintain a straight posture while standing in Tadasana on a mat or the ground. For support, place your palms on your waist with your fingers pointing forward. Bend backwards as much as you can gradually while supporting your waist with your hands. Hold this Ardha Chakrasan pose while maintaining your balance and having regular breathing. Slowly return to your starting posture as you exhale, and then take a moment to unwind, observing the changes in your breathing and the stretched places. Depending on your ability, repeat this exercise three to five times within five minutes.</section>

        <img src="https://manage.ayurbethaniya.org/uploads/media/Vajrasana%20(1)66dee1c1c2d45.jpg"class="image2" />
    Vajrasan is a basic seated posture found in yoga. The Sanskrit word vajra, which means diamond or thunderbolt, is where the expression originates. Vajrasana also helps with digestion, eases or prevents constipation, and strengthens the muscles in the pelvis. To begin, kneel on the floor, preferably on a yoga mat. Align your feet with your legs, pull your knees and ankles together, and make sure your big toes touch the bottoms of your feet as you face upward. Breathe out while you recline on your legs, placing your thighs on your calves and your buttocks on your heels. Once you find a comfortable posture, place your hands on your thighs and move your pelvis slightly back and forward. Slowly inhale and exhale while erecting your back, pulling your body up with your head, and pushing your tailbone towards the ground. With your chin parallel to the floor and your hands palm down on your thighs and your arms relaxed, hold your head straight and look forward.</section></li>

It can involve a variety of exercises like running, lifting weights, or yoga, and is performed for reasons such as increasing strength, improving cardiovascular health, managing weight, or simply for enjoyment.

    <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwjgZPXwqhrGkLhBarYk95-2120-80.jpg" class="image2"/>
<li>Strength training involves moving your muscles against some form of resistance, such as your own body weight, free weights, or resistance bands, to increase muscle mass and strength. Health experts recommend engaging in muscle-strengthening exercises for all major muscle groups </li>
<li>Important Tips:</li>
1.Focus on proper form to prevent injuries. If you're new, consider working with a trainer to learn the correct technique.
<br>
2.Breathe properly by exhaling during the most strenuous part of the exercise (lifting the weight) and inhaling during the less strenuous part (lowering the weight).<br>
3.Rest for at least one full day between working the same muscle groups to allow them to recover and grow stronger.<br>
4.Progressive overload: To continue building strength, gradually increase the weight or the number of sets and repetitions you perform over time.
5.Cool down with static stretches after your workout to reduce muscle tension and soreness. <br>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/skill-yoga.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/flexibility1.jpg?resize=900%2C600&ssl=1"class="image3"/>
<li>A workout focused on flexibility and balance should include a mix of static and dynamic stretches along with specific balance-challenging exercises. Incorporate these activities at least two to three times a week, with stretching performed when muscles are warm (after a light warm-up or a workout).</li>
Balance exercises target your core, lower back, and leg muscles to improve stability and coordination. Use a wall or sturdy chair for support as needed, especially when starting. <br>
Single-Leg Stand: Stand on one leg for up to 30 seconds. As you improve, try doing it with your eyes closed or while brushing your teeth.<br>
Heel-to-Toe Walk: Walk in a straight line, placing the heel of your front foot directly against the toes of your back foot (like a tightrope walk). Focus on a fixed point ahead.<br>
Weight Shifts (Rock the Boat): Stand with feet hip-width apart. Slowly shift your weight to one leg, lifting the other foot off the floor. Hold for up to 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.<br>
Tree Pose (Yoga): Stand and place the sole of one foot against the ankle, shin, or inner thigh of the standing leg (avoid the knee joint). Hold the position, using a wall for support if necessary.<br>
Sideways Walking: Stand with feet together and step sideways in a slow, controlled manner for 10 steps in one direction, then return.<br></section>
